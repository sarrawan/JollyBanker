For Lab 5, I have 6 classes: Bank, Account, ApplyTransactions, CheckTransactions, Funds, 
BSTree. The Bank class deals with reading in the file into a queue, executing all the 
transactions from the queue, and printing out the open accounts. The Account class is 
for each of the accounts in the Bank. It keeps track of the first and last name and the 
account ID. This class also keeps track of all the funds and the history of transactions 
for each account. The Account class deals with the Funds class, with each account having 
an array of 10 funds (1 for each of the 10 funds an account can have). The Funds class is 
for keeping track of the balance in each of the funds for an account and the history of 
the single fund. The ApplyTransactions class is what actually executes each of the 
transactions. However, before the transactions are executed, the CheckTransactions class 
makes sure the transaction is valid and can be done. For example, the CheckTransactions class
will check to make sure that there are no duplicates of accounts before opening a new account.
The BSTree class has all the accounts in the bank and is placed in the private part of the 
Bank class. Traversing through the tree at the end for phase 3 will print out all the open 
accounts and their balances in the funds.
